What age group should we market for the different bikes that we need to advertise. What our people perference for commuting to long distance and short distance. Also what gender purchase more bikes.

PrePare:
The data was download from Kaggle Dataset. The data is organized by people who have bought their bikes and people that have not. The data is orginal since it is respected and comes from Kaggle. I used Excel to open the dataset. When I opned the dataset I had to check is there any duplicate values in the data set. I used the duplicate tool to remove any duplicate values. I used the If Statement to assign a certain age ranges that meet the criteria. We create a Pivot table to see what age group purchae their bike.Also how far they biked the people who buy their bikes.


Conclusion
-The age group that buy the most bikes is the middle age group. Where as Young people and Old people don't ride bikes as much as the Middle age group. 
- Male buy more bikes than women.
- People will buy their bikes based on their income if it cost alot to buy it.
- People only use their bikes if there is short commute  less than 10 miles
