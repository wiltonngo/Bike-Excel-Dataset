What age group should we market for the different bikes that we need to advertise. What our people perference for commuting to long distance and short distance. Also what gender purchase more bikes.

PrePare:
The data that we use to address this question is to grab the data from people who buy bikes vs the people who loan their bikes. We used Excel to analyze our Data. First we check to see if there any duplicate data, or data that does not belong there, or null values. Next we will create an If Statement to cateogrize certain age group if they are young,middle-age or old. We also will create an another if statement to see the people who are buying the bikes are married or single.The next part is to create mutliple Pivot Table to show the different kind of people who will be buying our bikes and their demographics. Lastly we will be creating a Dashboard to show what kind of Demographics that is in our Data.
